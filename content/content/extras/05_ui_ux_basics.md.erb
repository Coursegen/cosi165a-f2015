<%= homework_hdr %>
1. Read:
	* [Principles of User Interface Design](http://bokardo.com/principles-of-user-interface-design/)
	* [Effective Use of white space in forms](http://www.nngroup.com/articles/form-design-white-space).
	* [Affordances and Metaphor](http://www.joelonsoftware.com/uibook/chapters/fog0000000060.html).
	* **Prepare to be called on to discuss one of these principles.**
1. Look at: [Five Second Test](http://fivesecondtest.com) and choose an aspect of your product to test using this site. It can be a paper mockup, a product name, a tag line, or anything else. <%= deliverable "post of what you tested and what the result was. Include a link to the site or a screen capture of the result." %>
* Begin work on final deliverables
	* Review <%= link_to_topic :term_project_framework %>
	* Review final deliverables: <%= link_to_topic :cs165a_final_deliverables %>
	* Meet with your teammates to discuss how you will approach producting the Term Project final deliverables. There are three fairly significant pieces, so talk over how you will split the work.
	* <%= bold_red("Come prepared to ask for clarifications, or suggest changes to the Term Project final deliverables. Also come prepared to explain how your team will approach the final deliverables.") %>

#### Discussion
* Discussion of the readings

#### Designing the User Experience
* Difference between UX and UI?
* What is good UX? Is it just a matter of opinion?

##### Looking at some existing products: 5-10 minute exercise
* Make some notes *about the user experience* for discussion after examining these two well known sites.
* Think about the UX and UI principles we've looked at
* Work independently but it's ok to look over each others shoulders :)
	* [Facebook](http://www.facebook.com/) - Something you know well. Find a few good and a few bad user interface elements. Have you ever tried to get someone (like a parent) to use Facebook? What worked and what did not? What is the most confusing?
	* [Latte](http://latte.brandeis.edu) - Let's examine the UI and UX and think about your own use of Latte. What are the top good and bad things about the user experience. Focus not on taste, but on specific concepts we have discussed.

<%= include_topic :ux_basics %>

##### Let's look at some sites

Split into project teams and a different one from below without checking what it is. Don't just click on the front page, try to use the site. Analyze and report back:

* What does the site do?
* Are the affordances you expect present?
* Can you locate the key functions and purposes?
* What's good and/or bad about each one?
* Refer back to all the principles

Here's the list:

* [Site 1](https://plus.google.com)
* [Site 2](http://www.pozible.com/create)
* [Site 3](http://www.mapmyfitness.com)
* [Site 4](http://www.udemy.com)
* [Site 5](https://www.remind101.com)
* [Site 6](http://www.feedbackarmy.com)
* [Site 7](http://www.rememberthemilk.com)

#### Conclusion
* I want you to always refer back to principles such as these when you design or present a user experience.
* It's very easy to say, "Oh it's common sense." But you submit designs that violate these principles left and right.
* It's important. Make it part of your toolkit. Internalize it! Take care!
