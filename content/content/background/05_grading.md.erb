#### Notes and comments

* We ( link_to_background :teachers) will be using Latte to collect assessments which build up into your grade. You can talk to either of us about what you see there and whether we've missed a homework or whatever.

* You will notice that even though this is a 100 point scale, there is an extra credit section that gives you a possibility of as much as 115 points!

* Class participation includes basic things like being in class when it starts, participating in the discussion, speaking up and contributing to the overall success of the course. It also means being prepared with the assigned readings so you know what it was about and have follow up questions. Sometimes the reading might confuse you initially, but then you bring good discussion questions to class.

* Grade scores in Latte: You will see that all your work is marked inside of Latte with a number from 0 to 10, see link_to_topic :scores. It is not the case that you have to get "all 10's" in order to get an A. There will be a simple arithmetic calculation with a factor to adjust for the actual difficulty of the class and the assignments.

#### Working in teams

* In my experience, on rare occasions, one member of the team becomes a bystander while others do the work, or one member takes over and does almost all the work. This is not the idea, so I might confidentially ask students their view of how well the team is functioning.

* For team deliverables each student on the team will get the same score on each item. A student will likely be on a different team for the pilot vs. the term project but in any event, each member of the team gets the same score on each team deliverable.

* Notice that separate from the grade for team deliverables there is an individual grade for your work as a team member. Are you an active contributor, do the other team members rely and count on you, do you add to or delete from the drama

* Every team member is expected to work on the deliverable, in some capacity, to some extent. I don't expect you to take turns typing on the keyboard, just so there's reasonable sharing of contribution.

#### Extra Credit

* You need to check with Pito or one of the TAs before you take one of these on.

* Extra work can yield as much as 15 extra points. This is a possible bonus that you can use to compensate or add to your metrics if you want to put in some extra work.

* We will inform you as the term progresses of opportunities for this, and they will be listed here too.

* Extra credit assignments
	* Create a Kickstarter or HubRocket (or other) crowdsource campaign for your term project. It is up to you whether you submit it or not. If you do this, be serious about it and do a great job. A video is required. (up to 10 points)

	* Read one of the articles from link_to_background :links and write a thoughtful post about it, where you don't just summarize or parrot it back, but give a unique insight, challenge, controversy, or case study inspired by the article (1 point each, up to possible 3 points)
