#### Course Description

The most common trap that we all fall into when we become enamored with a new product or business idea is to assume that our own personal experience and intuition is a valid measure of the likelyhood of success. At the highest level then, this course is about thinking, measuring and experimenting, before taking the leap to start implementation.

Over the semester, students will be exposed to key ideas, principles, techniques and theories that can be brought to bear in the earliest phase of a startup project, before funding and before implementation. The course is organized around extensive, hands-on application of these tools, where students will work in teams to drive towards a fully realized product concept, prototype, market validation and business plan.

The course takes the perspective of the 'technical co-founder' of a computing startup. Being a technical co-founder requires, beyond computer science and programming chops, a diverse set of other skills and perspectives.

##### Course Themes
1. The Lean Startup: A specific set of concepts, framework, theory and methodology to be applied to sort through product-market-fit, to help the entrepreneur steer the early work on a path to commercial success. While the Lean Startup framework is not the only one around, it is at present well respected among the computing related startup community.
1. On the ground experience: Central to the way this course works is that all students will be applying what they learn directly to the validation of a real product. In fact they will do this twice. Once, quickly, working on a specific product idea we supply. And then we will go through the whole lean startup process a second time, more gradually, on a product or business concept of their own devising.
1. Project and Team Work: No matter what direction a student ends up pursuing, we believe that the great majority of worthy endeavors are the result of team's collaboration. Therefore we put a high value on being successful working on a team for a major product. Teams invariably experience challenges in setting and agreeing on goals, making and meeting mutual commitments, accepting team members' diversity of interest, talent, motivation. These will all be occasions for learning and improving students success.
