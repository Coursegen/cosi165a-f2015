In this course you will work on taking a cool app or software brainstorm and turn it into a viable business. We'll look at many different perspectives to better define the idea, test it with customers, and figure out the key risks and costs, and finally make a go-no go decision. (This course was called "IT Entpreneurship and was renamed. It is mostly the same course."

**We want to take an idea** -- let's say a 'good idea' (see <%= link_to_topic :ideas_are_cheap %>) -- to fruition as a business that has a chance to make real money and/or have an big imact on a many real people's lives. Not a hobby that you pursue because you'd like to learn and grow -- which is fine -- but something that you have real reason to believe will make a big difference. It is said that 9 out of 10 startups fail. Our goal is to improve your odds.

**This is not a software engineering course!**It is a course that helps you discover and practice the discipline and tools to develop your idea and to assure that it will
meet its goals - like making money and/or having an actual real impact on the world.

I use the line "is this a hobby or a business." For this course I am not interested in doing a project because it's fun or you get to learn how to use rails or javascript. Those are great personal goals which are fine but will not effect a change in the world.
