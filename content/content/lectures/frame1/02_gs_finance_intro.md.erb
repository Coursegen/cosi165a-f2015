1. Reflect on your personal reactions and feelings on the Lean Startup technique. Please don't simply parrot what's in the book. Pause to think about what it has been like to apply it so far. What are some key learnings? How would you explain it to a friend? What parts of it don't you think are valuable? <%= deliverable "Post with your personal reflection" %>
1. From Jeffrey Beir: View this video: http://mjskok.com/resource/funding-strategies-to-go-distance.  I wonâ€™t cover all this financing strategy in this, but will focus more on how to think about milestones, capital and proof. <%= deliverable "Do warmup quiz for today's reading" %>
1. From Jeffrey Beir: Consider your term project. Answer these questions: 1) How would you define success at your first milestone? 2) How will you measure that success, e.g. which independent metrics will you show? <%= deliverable "Post your answer to those questions." %>
