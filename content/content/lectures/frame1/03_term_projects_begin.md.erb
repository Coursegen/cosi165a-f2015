I want to build on last Thursday's meeting. So, in order to make today's class most effective I am asking you to invest real time and effort into the preparation. Basically for the product ideas that you are the most optimistic about, I would like you to go another level deeper. 

Referring again to the [Cosi165a Pairs Spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1wJ-as72YAfvgmigh_UgYtk9V40f6b2e3-G0F2_8ryss/edit#gid=0), I need every student to review and update that spreadsheet, as follows.
1. Every student needs to be mentioned in the spreadsheet. Either as a member of a pair or by yourself.
1. Every student needs a link
