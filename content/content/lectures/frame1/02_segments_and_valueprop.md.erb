1. After reading the above article on your own, get together with your project team, spending 1-2 hours together
	* Discuss and decide on the Term Project you want to pursue.
	* *Everyone listen to each other*: What is your vision of the product? Try to be specific. Of course you still have to research it but trying to get aligned is very important!
	* Review <%= link_to_topic :frame_1_report %> to help you think it through
	* Discuss and debate the "[Value Proposition Canvas](http://www.businessmodelgeneration.com/downloads/value_proposition_canvas.pdf)" and how it applies to your project.

1. An entrepreneur has to learn to think strategically, analytically and carefully when evaluating what to do, how to do it, and what to do next. 
  * Read [Delivery Startups are Back like it's 1999](http://www.nytimes.com/2014/08/24/magazine/delivery-start-ups-are-back-like-its-1999.html). Think about the idea of a delivery startup on campus. 
  * What might be some of the advantages of targeting college students? What are characteristics of them as a customer base which would make it hard for a fedex or amazon to deliver to them? What are some of their needs which might be different and hard to meet by a general business? How would you test some of these questions and assumptions? What kinds of products might be amenable? Is there room to capitalize on the slowness of the mailroom? What products, services, customers, campuses, geographies, and any other characteristics might be relevant? Is this a worthwhile idea to pursue?
  * <%= deliverable "Write up your thoughts on 'On Campus Delivery Startups: An untapped opportunity?' and some of the questions I raise above" %>
1. Write a self and team assessment about your experience during the Pilot Project, touching on: What each person on your team, including yourself, did on the team, took responsibility for; give each one a grade, including yourself, and explain why you think they should get that grade. Your post will be confidential and supplement the instructors' view on your contribution to the team during the pilot phase. <%= deliverable "Posted on latte" %>

  * Positioning, value proposition, elevator Pitch
  * All different sides of the same coin, used differently
  * These definitions are not precise and the terminology is not set in stone.
  * People will argue about them but you need to be familiar with how to talk about your product effectively.
