	* <%= link_to_topic :final_deliverables %>
	* <%= link_to_topic :term_project_report_draft_1 %>
1. Watch 1 episode of ["Shark Tank"](http://abc.go.com/shows/shark-tank), a TV show about fake venture capitalists. <%= deliverable "Write a blog post with some reactions and reflections. How did the show make you feel? What surprised you? Did it change your mind?"%>
1. Term product ideas. Again, get together for around 60 minutes minutes with 1-2 "new" students. Talk through your term project ideas, make new ones, brainstorm and look at [Student Term Project proposals so far](https://moodle2.brandeis.edu/mod/data/view.php?id=284444). <%= deliverable "Each student please +1 or -1 at least 3 other projects as replies." %>.

#### Plan for today
* Open discussion on working on projects in teams
	* Clarifying what it means to be on a project
	* Team dynamics is hard. Alignment is hard
	* Start by talking over what product your team wants to pick
	* What is your lattitude around the basic vision?
