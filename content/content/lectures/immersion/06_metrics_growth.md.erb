<%= homework_hdr %>

1. PTPTours pilot team: meet as a team. *Sorry that this description is so long, I just want to give you detailed instructions!!*
	* Review and update your trello board with new or refined hypotheses. You are now getting more serious. I'd like to see meaningful set of hypotheses. You already have problem and customer hypotheses. Tighten them up.
	* You should also be clarifying more specifically who the customer is and where you could find one.You should now be working on solution hypotheses to try and validate. Essentially, what features do the customers want? Do they want a live tour guide or a recorded tour? Do they want a variety of types of tours, and if so, based on what? Expertise of the guide? Age of the guide?
	* Take more steps to get out of the building and validate more hypotheses. You can use surveys, but also personal meetings, emails, facebook, searching through newsgroups and any of the other techniques we've discussed.
	* Look at deliverables defined here: <%=link_to_topic :pilot_project %>. <%= team_deliverable "Create first draft of this pilot project report." %>
1. Term product ideas:
	* Get together for around 60 minutes minutes with 1-2 other students, not on your team. Talk through your term project ideas, make new ones, brainstorm and look at [Student Term Project proposals so far](https://moodle2.brandeis.edu/mod/forum/view.php?id=134683). <%= deliverable "Each student please +1 at least 3 other projects as replies." %>.
1. Read: [Seven Lessons I learned from the failure of my first startup](https://medium.com/@michalbohanes/seven-lessons-i-learned-from-the-failure-of-my-first-startup-dinnr-c166d1cfb8b8). <%= deliverable "A forum post with a reflection. Ask yourself some quesions: Have I seen similar mistakes made? Could I see myself make the same misjudgements? Were the problems with the product forseable? How?" %>
