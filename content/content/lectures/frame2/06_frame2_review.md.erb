1. Combine what each team member did individually last time with the design of the data model. Include a clear indication of each table (==entitity), what columns (==attribute or property) each one has, what the relationship the tables have to each other (1-1, 1-many, many-1, many-many), and what the primary and foreign keys are. <%= team_deliverable "Generate a new, more detailed schema" %>

		Example format:

		Table: Course
		Attributes: ID, course_name, course_number

		Table: Student
		Attributes: ID, First_name, Last_name, Grad_year

		Table: Enrollment
		Attributes: ID, Student:ID, Course:ID

		Relationships:
		Student -> Enrollment is One to Many
		Course -> Enrollment is One to Many
		Course <-> Student is Many to Many

	Of course if you want to make a diagram, that's ok too.
