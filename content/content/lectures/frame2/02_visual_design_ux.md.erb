#### General Notes about Frame 1
* **Think bigger.** You will need to make a case that the product will be a viable business.
* **Be Serious.** Your work is evaluated not just on whether you follow the steps or the format but based on whether you are being realistic and intellectually honest about your proposal. Would you actually pitch this to an Angel?
* **Get Out.** Everyone needs to get out of the building more. Go beyond your friends. Talk to strangers!
* **Pivot.** If you need to. Real startups pivot if the evidence is not coming in. Zoom out pivot if your idea is too small. 
* **Presentation.** Professional, neat, readable etc.
* **Frame 2.** You will have a chance to improve and revise Frame 1, as it is part of Frame 2

#### Discussion
* Review of homework

#### Designing the User Experience
* Difference between UX and UI?
* What is good UX? Is it just a matter of opinion?

##### Looking at some existing products: 5-10 minute exercise
* Make some notes *about the user experience* for discussion after examining these two well known sites.
* Think about the UX and UI principles we've looked at
* Work independently but it's ok to look over each others shoulders :) 
	* [Facebook](http://www.facebook.com/) - Something you know well. Find a few good and a few bad user interface elements. Have you ever tried to get someone (like a parent) to use Facebook? What worked and what did not? What is the most confusing?
	* [Latte](http://latte.brandeis.edu) - Let's examine the UI and UX and think about your own use of Latte. What are the top good and bad things about the user experience. Focus not on taste, but on specific concepts we have discussed.

##### Let's look at some sites

Split into project teams and a different one from below without checking what it is. Don't just click on the front page, try to use the site. Analyze and report back: 

* What does the site do?
* Are the affordances you expect present?
* Can you locate the key functions and purposes?
* What's good and/or bad about each one? 
* Refer back to all the principles

Here's the list:

* [Site 1](https://plus.google.com)
* [Site 2](http://www.pozible.com/create)
* [Site 3](http://www.mapmyfitness.com)
* [Site 4](http://www.udemy.com)
* [Site 5](https://www.remind101.com)
* [Site 6](http://www.feedbackarmy.com)
* [Site 7](http://www.rememberthemilk.com)

#### Conclusion
* I want you to always refer back to principles such as these when you design or present a user experience. 
* It's very easy to say, "Oh it's common sense." But you submit designs that violate these principles left and right.
* It's important. Make it part of your toolkit. Internalize it! Take care!
