* Business Model Canvas (by Alexander Osterwalter)
	* Watch this video introducing the concept by Alexander Osterwalder: [Tools for Business Model Generation](http://ecorner.stanford.edu/authorMaterialInfo.html?mid=2875). Pay *special attention* to this:
		* Try to understand really what is meant by the term **business model**. Think about how that applies to your product. Think about what a business built around it would work.
		* He organizes the space into nine **building blocks** And then illustrates a series of questions to think about in each block and start seeing the relationships between them. Try to really understand what each block is about and that you follow is example.
	* Divide up the Business Canvas 'building blocks' among your team, so each student will have two or three blocks.. Review the part of the video that pertains to your blocks. Also you might do some web research about the blocks you are responsible for.
	* <%= deliverable "Blog post with thoughts and responses to 'your block' specifically as it relates to your term project." %>
* Term Project Teams:
	* Discuss and write down product feature stories. See <%= link_to_lecture :mockups_prototypes %> for a reminder on how to do them. Feature stories should be 1 sentence and fairly "granular." You should order them from most important to least important. It's ok if the later ones are not backed by a proven hypothesis, yet. But eventually and ideally all the stories should have such empirical backing.
	* <%= team_deliverable "Prioritized list of stories" %>
* Continue and complete your <%= link_to_topic :frame_1_report_peer_review %>.
	* Create a write up of how you assessed the three considerations of the other team's product, and also summarizing what the other team and you heard in terms of feedback about your product. Make sure you include the team names and team member names. <%= team_deliverable "Peer review writeup" %>

#### Discussion
* Lets take a look at some of the story lists from the projects, and discuss what we see there. Think about:
	* Why are the priorities the way they are, do they make sense?
	* Are the stories clear enough to actually execute/implement?
	* Are there any obvious omissions? For example, if the product assumes a two sided market or user base, are they represented in the stories?

<%= include_topic :business_model_canvas %>

#### Conclusions - Business Model Canvas
* Assures that you consider and address all the pieces of your business model
* Is it a business or a hobby? Business includes much more than just the product
* Gives you a way to partition the work, and present the results

#### Next Class
