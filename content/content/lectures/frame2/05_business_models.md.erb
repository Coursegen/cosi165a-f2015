* **Teams**: Work up the Business Model Canvas (by Alexander Osterwalter): Watch this video introducing the concept by Alexander Osterwalder: [Tools for Business Model Generation](http://ecorner.stanford.edu/authorMaterialInfo.html?mid=2875). (It's a little long and repetitive but it does explain the concept well.) Pay *special attention* to this:
	* Try to understand really what is meant by the term **business model**. Think about how that applies to your product. Think about what a business built around it would work.
	* He organizes the space into nine **building blocks** And then illustrates a series of qïœ©uestions to think about in each block and start seeing the relationships between them. Try to really understand what each block is about and that you follow is example.
	* Divide up the Business Canvas 'building blocks' among your team, so each student will have two or three blocks.. Review the part of the video that pertains to your blocks. Also you might do some web research about the blocks you are responsible for.
	* (Individual) <%= deliverable "Post to Latte your thoughts and responses to 'your block' specifically as it relates to your term project." %>
* **Teams**: Choose another team to be your 'peer'. Read each others' Draft Term Project Report (see <%= link_to_topic :term_report_draft_peer_review %>). <%= team_deliverable "Write up your thoughts as explained." %>**\[GRADED FOR PARTICIPATION ONLY\]**
* **Teams** Meet for at least 2 hours per week to continue refining your product, getting more feedback and supporting information. You can also start working on a paper prototype, mockup or similar, all of which you will need for your final deliverables.
