### Random Discussions and Pizza!

* Read this article before giving your presentation: [How to nail a presentation](http://www.bothsidesofthetable.com/2013/10/20/how-to-nail-a-presentation-to-a-crowd/)

* How is the preparation going for the final showcase? Who wants to present their current presentation to the class for feedback?

* Please look at the overall set of lectures we had (<%= link_to_section(:welcome, :coursetoc) %>). Suggest changes in emphasis or ordering?

* How did I (Pito) feel about the course? What would I change?
	* I feel that I should have emphasized a little more the creation of a web page to do more surveying.
	* I really like the set of products you came up with. (Yes, some were mine too.) In fact I plan to use some of them for the next course.


#### THANKS! To everyone and especially our TAs!
